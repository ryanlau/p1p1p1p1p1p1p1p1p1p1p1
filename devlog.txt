Overall our feedback was primarily positive in terms of the idea and our plans to implement it.
One group pointed out that we differentiated between user_ids and usernames, which was not necessary.
Another group was confused regarding the additional pages that are linked to the dashboard/homepage.
Update design doc to clarify that widgets on dashboard link to pages with in depth information, add post-MVP features, and get rid of user_ids.
Change the APIs for quotes and for stock market information in design doc to ones that are easier to use.
