## App Description

A personal dashboard to keep your life in order! 

On the dashboard, we will display the weather, sunrise/sunset time, stock data, an inspirational quote for the day, a list of news articles, and an area to write to-do items. Each widget will link to a page that displays more in-depth information when clicked on by the user.
